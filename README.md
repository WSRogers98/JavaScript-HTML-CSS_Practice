# JavaScript-HTML-CSS_Practice
Thes are some poractice problems I did in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. all of these practice problems were available through lynda, Linkdin's learning service. These were on the "Become a Front-End Web Developer" learning path.

These projects are not school related and are just for personal growth.
